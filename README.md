### **Summary:**

<center>
This IT Journal reflects a structured progression in developing core technical and analytical skills relevant to a Technical Analyst position. Over these days, I explored hands-on IT fundamentals, system administration, and troubleshooting workflows used in real-world environments. Key focus areas included setting up and managing Active Directory, DNS, and DHCP; building and testing an IT lab environment; configuring Microsoft 365 Business and Azure services; and understanding ticketing systems for incident management. Additionally, I strengthened my networking knowledge and communication skills essential for effective cross-team collaboration and technical documentation. This experience has built a solid foundation in systems analysis, IT operations, and problem-solving; directly aligning with the responsibilities of a Technical Analyst.

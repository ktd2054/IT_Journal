# Microsoft Entra

Microsoft Entra = Identity + Access + Security
It’s the backbone of authentication and authorisation in Microsoft cloud environments.

Microsoft Entra ID, formerly Azure Active Directory, is Microsoft’s cloud-based identity and access management service. Organizations 
use Microsoft Entra ID to enable their employees, guests, and others to sign in and access the resources they need, including:

Internal resources, such as apps on your corporate network and intranet, and cloud apps developed by your own organization.
External services, such as Microsoft Office 365, the Azure portal, and any SaaS applications used by your organization.

Microsoft Entra ID simplifies the way organizations manage authorization and access by providing a single identity system for
their cloud and on-premises applications. Microsoft Entra ID can be synchronized with your existing on-premises Active Directory, 
synchronized with other directory services, or used as a standalone service.

Microsoft Entra ID also allows organizations to securely enable the use of personal devices, such as mobiles and tablets, 
and enable collaboration with business partners and customers.

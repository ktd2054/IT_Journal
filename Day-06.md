# Active Directory Basics

It is used for managing computers and other devices on a network, providing a centralized location for network administration and security. Active Directory stores information about members of the domain, including devices and users, and allows administrators to manage permissions and access to network resources.

### Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)

Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) is the core component of Active Directory, providing a structured, hierarchical data storage for objects such as users, computers, and printers. It allows for secure, organized management of these objects and supports various network services like authentication and authorization. AD DS also includes features such as a global catalog, which provides a searchable, read-only copy of all objects in the directory, and replication services that ensure data consistency across multiple domain controllers.

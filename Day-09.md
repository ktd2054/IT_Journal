# Networking

Networking is the practice of connecting two or more computing devices together so they can exchange information. 
This is done using a combination of:
- Hardware (routers, switches, cables)
- Software (operating systems, firewalls)
- Protocols (rules like TCP/IP)

The main objective of networking is resource sharing. This means allowing multiple devices (like computers, printers, and servers) 
to communicate with each other to share data, services (like internet access), and hardware (like a shared printer).

### Summary 

#### What I'm Doing in This Networking Section?

In this section, I'm learning the practical, hands-on skills for a Level 1 (L1) network support job.
I'm moving beyond just knowing what terms like TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP, and Routers mean. 
I'm using a network simulator to build a virtual small office network from scratch to see how all these services work together.
The main goal is to practice real-world troubleshooting. I'm intentionally breaking the network in different ways 
and then using standard IT support tools to diagnose the problem and fix it, just like in a real-world scenario.

# Project: Building an IT Lab using VirtualBox

### Summary:
Designed and configured a virtual IT lab using Oracle VirtualBox to simulate real-world enterprise environments for hands-on learning and troubleshooting practice. The lab included multiple virtual machines representing client and server systems, configured with Windows and Linux operating systems. Implemented Active Directory, network configurations, and user management to practice IT support, system administration, and cybersecurity fundamentals.

### Key Tasks & Achievements:

- Installed and configured VirtualBox to run isolated test environments.

- Created and managed Windows 10/11, Windows Server, and Ubuntu virtual machines.

- Set up Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) for user authentication and policy testing.

- Practiced network troubleshooting (IP addressing, DNS, DHCP, ping, and remote connections).

- Simulated help desk scenarios like password resets, user access requests, and software deployment.

- Tested snapshot, backup, and restore features to understand disaster recovery basics.

- Strengthened practical understanding of IT infrastructure, support workflows, and system security.

### Tools & Technologies:
VirtualBox, Windows Server, Active Directory, PowerShell, Ubuntu, Remote Desktop, Networking tools.
